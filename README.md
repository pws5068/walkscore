# Walkscore
This is a gem for interacting with the Walkscore Api.  You can easily request the walkscore of any given city by just passing in the lat and long of a given city.  You will need an API key from walkscore first.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'walkscore'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install walkscore

## Usage

### There is only one external method you will be using to interact with the api.

### WalkscoreApi::Walkscore.find({lat: 40.7143528 , long: -74.00597309999999 }, API_KEY)
That's it!  You're response will be a Walkscore object where you have access to the following methods
+ score
+ description
+ updated
+ logo_url
+ ws_link
+ Contributing

### If an array of locations is passed, the response will be an array of Walkscore objects in the order they were requested
`WalkscoreApi::Walkscore.find([{lat: 40.7143 , long: -74.0059 },{lat: 37.7833, long: -122.4167}], API_KEY)`
